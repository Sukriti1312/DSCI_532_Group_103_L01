United states have a high population of immigrants mostly 
from Asia who constitutes on of the largest workforce in the 
country.  
The newly elected Republican goverment headed by Mr. Donald
Trump promised to jobs to americans only. So the americans communities
felt immigrants communities are the reason for the high 
unemployment rate in the country. This led to a surge
in reports of [hate crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_crime)
as per media reports. We liked to verify this report of media
and also the causes of these crimes. The dashboard app tries to find 
out the relation between several factors like income, unemployment,
etc. with the recent hate crime records.The app has several filters and drop-down menus for filtering and 
ordering the data. Here we just explore our data with visualizations
and leave the conclusion to the viewer/user.
