In a country like United States with large number of immigrant population, this is a major concern for the authorities. So we analysed the past

income, unemployment, education, etc. with the recent hate crime records. Firstly we tried to identify the distribution of hate crimes across US
states and various factors which might affect the crime rate. Secondly out app will also show the difference caused US general elections of 2016
