 [Hate crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_crime) in the US has been the talking point in media lately. 
In a country like the United States with large numbers of immigrant population, this is a major concern for the authorities. We have analysed past 
hate crime data and tried to delve deeper into the causes of these crimes. Our dashboard app tries to find out the relation between demographics data of 
income, unemployment, education, etc. with hate crime records. Firstly, we tried to identify the distribution of hate crimes across US
states and various factors which might affect the crime rate. Secondly, our app will also show the differences caused by the US general elections of 2016 
across the hate crime rates.
